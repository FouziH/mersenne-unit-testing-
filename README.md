## Mersenne unit testing 


Automated Testing 

=== Writing code, to test that your code works


Manual Testing 

=== Clicking and poking around and seeing if it works 

Benefits of testing 

    --- Automate the manual stuff, potentially saving time 
    --- Risk mitigation 
        -- Lower the risk of deployment 
    --- Makes deployment cheaper, easier, less scary 
    --- âœ… dopamine 
    
Cost of testing 
- Takes a while to write 

## Test Driven Development (TDD)
"Test-driven development (TDD) is a development technique where you must first write a test that fails before you write new functional code. TDD is being quickly adopted by agile software developers for development of application source code and is even being adopted by Agile DBAs for database development."

-- Write the test  first 
-- watch them fail 
-- Fix them

** Works really if you understand the technical scope of what your  building
